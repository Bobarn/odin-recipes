        <h4><u>Instructions:</u></h4>
            <dl>
                <dt><em>Step 1.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Remove the cabbage leaves, wash them, and trim off the stem of the cabbage </dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 2.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanche the cabbage leaves for about 1 minute to soften them for rolling later. Afterwards remove them from the water and lay on cloth or paper towels to dry.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 3.</em></dt>
                    <dd>While the cabbage dries we'll work on the filling. In a large, non-stick frying pan drizzle the sesame oil over medium-high heat and saute your white scallion parts and garlic until fragrant (about 2 minutes). </dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 4.<em></dt>
                    <dd>Add the carrots (and shiitake) and cook until soft before adding in the pork and stirring on heat until fully cooked.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 5.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Once the pork is fully cooked, we stir and fold in the soy sauce and vinegar before proceeding to add the cooked rice.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 6.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Once everything has combined evenly and the liquid has reduced we will add in the cornstarch and stir once more until the filling has become sticky and thick.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 7.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Season the filling with salt and white pepper to taste then set aside as we work on the sauce.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 8.<em></dt>
                    <dd>With a small drizzle of oil, fry the chopped scallion and the minced garlic until fragrant and the onions become slightly transparent.</dd>
                <dt><em>Step 9.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Add the soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar and bring the mixture to a gentle boil while stirring.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 10.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Mix the cornstarch into the sauce mixture and allow the mixture to continue to heat and thicken until a desired consistency is achieved.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 11.</em></dt>
                    <dd>Set the sauce aside and return to your filling and softened cabbage leaves. Add 1-2 spoonfuls of filling to the base of a leaf and then roll from the base to the edge into something akin to a cabbage bedroll. Repeat for all 14 leaves.</dd>
                    <br>
                <dt><em>Step 12.<em></dt>
                    <dd>Take the cabbage rolls and drizzle the sauce over them once you are done rolling. (If the rolls are cold at this point, you can heat them in the pan once more for a few minutes.) Enjoy!</dd>
